--------------------
### Doubly linked list using python.

Depends on node class. Linked list methods include:
Insertion:
prepend_node - add new head node
append_node = add new tail node
insert_at_index - insert node at indicated index

Deletion:
pop_left - deletion of head node
pop_right - deletion of tail node
delete_index - deletion of node at indicated index

QoL:
display - provides visual of linked list
length - gives length of linked list
traverse - allows for traversal and print out of nodes and their associated values and indices

--------------------
### Queue using python.

Depends on node class. Queue methods include:

enqueue - add new tail node to the queue
dequeue - remove head node and return value
peek - observe head node's value
display - human readable representation of the queue

--------------------
### Stack using python.

Depends on node class. Stack methods include:

push - add new head node
pop - remove head node and return value
peek - observe head node's value
display - human readable representation of the queue
